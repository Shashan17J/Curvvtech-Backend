# Smart Device Management Platform

A Typescript + Node.js + Express + MongoDB application to manage **Users**, **Device** and their **DevicesLogs**.  
Each user is assigned a unique `userId` (`u1`, `u2`, ‚Ä¶) and each device a unique `deviceId` (`d1`, `d2`, ‚Ä¶) using auto-incrementing IDs.

## üöÄ Features

- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- Secure password hashing
- Middlewares
- Device registration linked to users
- Auto-generated `userId`,`deviceId` and `logId`
- ZOD Validation
- Background Cron Job
- Type Safety
- Secured Routes with JWT
- Unit Tests (using Jest)
- RESTful API with JSON responses

## Assumptions Made

- Each user has a unique userId (u1, u2, ‚Ä¶) generated automatically.
- Each device has a unique deviceId (d1, d2, ‚Ä¶).
- Each device logs has a unique logId (l1, l2 ...).
- Devices are always linked to users via owner_id and deviceId linked to device logs.
- Authentication uses JWT (sent via cookies).
